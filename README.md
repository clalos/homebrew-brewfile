# Homebrew Brewfile
Brewfile for my personal macOS/linux installation. 

The Brewfile can be used in two ways:
1. directly with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) by using the `brew bundle` command;
1. with [strap](https://github.com/MikeMcQuaid/strap) which performs additional configurations for the OS (recommended).
